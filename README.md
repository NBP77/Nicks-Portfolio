# Nicks-Portfolio
An updated collection of projects from Bootcamp 

## Description

-The main goal for this project was to create a portfolio website that can hold all of the projects I will create during this program. 
 
-Each img has a link to my projects, the two projects I decided to showcase are Park Finder amd Workday planner
